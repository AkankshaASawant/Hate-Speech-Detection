# Hate Speech Detection

This project involves the implementation of a machine learning pipeline to detect hate speech in text data. The goal is to classify text as hate speech or non-hate speech using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The project is structured to include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

## Introduction
Hate speech is a significant issue in online platforms, leading to the need for automated detection systems. This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach for hate speech detection, utilizing NLP techniques to preprocess text data and train classification models.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing labeled text data, where each sample is classified as either:
- **Hate Speech**
- **Non-Hate Speech**


## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Text cleaning (e.g., removing special characters, converting to lowercase).
   - Tokenization and lemmatization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzing class distribution.
   - Visualizing word frequencies and other text characteristics.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracting features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

4. **Model Building**
   - Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.
   - Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Prediction and Evaluation**
   - Testing the best model on unseen data.
   - Generating classification reports.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing of text data for hate speech detection.
- Use of TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- Implementation and comparison of multiple machine learning models.
- Visualization of EDA insights.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hate-speech-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hate-speech-detection
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebook
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `Hate_Speech_Detection.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## Results
- The final model achieved a classification accuracy of **94.30%** on the test set.
- Performance metrics (e.g., F1-score) are included in the notebook for detailed analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library.
- **nltk**: Natural language processing library.
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**: Visualization tools.

## Future Work
- Integrate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for better performance.
- Deploy the model using Flask or Django for real-time hate speech detection.
- Expand the dataset to include multilingual hate speech.
